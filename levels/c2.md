Navigates flawlessly within at least one other layer in addition to the App (Rails) / Metabase layer:
  - database in-and-out _e.g: index, how to administrate, how to make it efficient_
  - async processing in-and-out _e.g: jobs, efficient retry, idempotence_
  - mobile in-and-out _e.g: platform specificity, deployment_
  - deployment pipelines _e.g: heroku, github actions_
  - network infrastructure _e.g: dyno, private network_
