### Hats & How We

### Before writing code

- Presents technical problems with pro's & con's on multiple potential solutions spanning across multiple aprem / tech - cooldown / cycle 
  - Offer solutions to actively reduce complexity
  - Identifies large code refacto's to be later decomposed by them or other team members 
  - Anticipates new project, show POCs

_e.g: should we move away from Redis, merge EmailRule/User_

  
### When writing code

Navigates flawlesssly in many of other layer then the App (Rails) / Metabase layer:
  - database in-and-out _e.g: index, how to administrate, how to make it efficient_
  - async processing in-and-out _e.g: jobs, efficient retry, idempotence_
  - mobile in-and-out _e.g: platform specificity, deployment_
  - deployment pipelines _e.g: heroku, github actions_
  - network infrastructure _e.g: dyno, private network_
  - monitoring and observability _e.g: datadog, apm_
  - Data software and ETL _e.g: Fivetran_
