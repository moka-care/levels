### Scope

Theme

### Short

You know the codebase but youâ€™re not totally autonomous

### Hats & How We

Takes a Hat and make it progress - _details: a new Hat is available, request to take it, get onboarded and maintain it_

### Before writing code

- Participates many times to discussions on technical topics
  Participating means:
   - asking questions
   - raising challenges
   - explicitly agreeing on the proposed solutions

- Works closely with the Theme Owner and the Products to define the initial scope of Themes

### When writing code

- Owns the implementation of their projects once the scope is clearly defined
- Demonstrates willingness to work on all parts of the [codebase](https://github.com/moka-care/levels/blob/guidelines.md#code-vs-stack) - _e.g: the back, the front, the mobile, the emails, etc_

### After writing code

[Produce _and_ review PR with care](https://www.notion.so/mokacare/How-we-do-Pull-Requests-Reviews-845f5cc25fe04d5a95082174187e452e?pvs=4#5c15d3b650ee441783074d81eb8e34c7)
