| A1 | Personal | You are starting to learn how the system works | Follows our guidelines & Hows we do _e.g. How we do front, how we test, etc_ <hr/>  <hr/> Particpates in Theme or Reserve |  |  |  |  | Comments the queries |
| A2 | Personal | You are starting to learn how the system works |  |  | Completes clearly-defined tasks and reports blockers _e.g Some task has been defined during a Theme, advance on those_ | Writes pull requests that are easy to review and test for tech and product during multiples cycles |  | Writes self-explanatory queries |
| B1 | Theme | You master your tool but you’re not totally autonomous | Takes a Hat and make it progress _details: a new Hat is available, request to take it, get onboarded and improve it_ | Participates many times to discussions on technical topics, with a pragmatic mindset.  <hr/>   Participating means: <hr/>    asking questions <hr/>    raise challenges <hr/>    explicitely agreeing on the proposed solutions <hr/>  <hr/> Work closely with the Theme Owner and the Products to define the initial scope of multiple Themes | Owns the implementation of their projects once the scope is clearly defined <hr/> Demonstrates willingness to work on all parts of the codebase _e.g: the back, the front, the mobile, the emails, etc_ | Review their own PR to catch mistakes/typo before opening for review |  | Writes self-explanatory queries |
| B2 | You master your tool but you’re not totally autonomous | You are starting to learn how the system works | Writes a new Hat or How we do when the occasions presents itself | Has a sense of how to solve a business problem when they hear it described <hr/>   can suggest first potential solutions <hr/>   can document them in the Tech Spec note in accordance with the Theme Owner |  |  | Writes and maintains clear documentation on multiples topics _e.g like End Of theme Note, new tech discovery and sharing, chaning pattern in the app, etc_ | Makes dashboards known and accessible <hr/> Able to maintain other's dashboards and queries |
| C1 | Theme | You are fully autonomous on your job | Is a Theme Owner during multiples Themes | Presents technical problems linked to a Theme, their implications clearly and make sure other teams member are onboard _details: don't have to have all the solutions, but drive the process_ | Works on all parts of the codebase using all the standards with a simple approach: <hr/> Strictly follow existing pattern _e.g: active record first, no service by default, reuse code modelisation and naming, use view components, etc_ <hr/> Reuse existing data _e.g: no data duplication, ensure impossible state_ |  |  | Anticipates /presents data structure changes implications |
| C2 | Personal | You are starting to learn how the system works | Identifies useful new Hats <hr/> Gives some Hats back to the team <hr/> Looks for opportunities to mentor or coach other people on the team _e.g: could be with prez tech or actively coaching_ | Decomposess a technical or business issue into a solution spanning across multiple aprem / tech cooldown / cycle. _e.g: how to implement monitoring_ <hr/> Challenges technical choices with a pragmatic mindset by ensuring simplicity is respected, requesting clarification when it looks like it's not possible _details: on tech specs, on Pull Request_ | Navigates flawlesssly in one of other layer then the App (Rails) / Metabase layer: <hr/>   database in-and-out _e.g: index, how to administrate, how to make it efficient_ <hr/>   async processing in-and-out _e.g: jobs, efficient retry, idempotence_ <hr/>   mobile in-and-out _e.g: platform specificity, deployment_ <hr/>   deployment pipelines _e.g: heroku, github actions_ <hr/>   network infrastructure _e.g: dyno, private network_ <hr/>   monitoring and observability _e.g: datadog, apm_ <hr/>   Data software and ETL _e.g: Fivetran_ |  |  | See When writing code |
| D | Team | You actively make the team & app grow with sustainability in mind |  | Presents technical problems with pro's & con's on multiple potential solutions spanning across multiple aprem / tech cooldown / cycle  <hr/>   Offer solutions to actively reduce complexity <hr/>   Identifies large code refacto's to be later decomposed by them or other team members  <hr/>   Anticipates new project, show POCs <hr/>  <hr/> _e.g: should we move away from Redis, merge EmailRule/User_ | Navigates flawlesssly in many of other layer then the App (Rails) / Metabase layer: <hr/>   database in-and-out _e.g: index, how to administrate, how to make it efficient_ <hr/>   async processing in-and-out _e.g: jobs, efficient retry, idempotence_ <hr/>   mobile in-and-out _e.g: platform specificity, deployment_ <hr/>   deployment pipelines _e.g: heroku, github actions_ <hr/>   network infrastructure _e.g: dyno, private network_ <hr/>   monitoring and observability _e.g: datadog, apm_ <hr/>   Data software and ETL _e.g: Fivetran_ |  |  |  |
| E | Team | You identify and solve complex issues both technical and/or organizational | Ensures an healthy Hats distribution | Demonstrates creativity, e.g. by finding simple, generalizable solutions that open up or unblock new technical or business opportunities |  |  | Understands the entire technology ecosystem (even outside moka) <hr/> _e.g: follow on new tech trends, new possibilites and share with the team, showing possibilities_ |  |
| F | Moka | You work closely with other teams to make Engineering at moka better |  | Establishes a technical vision and co-drive the creation of the roadmap for the next quarters |  |  | Knows which levers to pull to drive meaningful results and understand the wider, cross-functional implications of their work. |  |
