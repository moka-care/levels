| C2 | Personal | You are autonomous on your job and start to make other grow | Identifies useful new Hats <hr/> Gives some Hats back to the team <hr/> Looks for opportunities to mentor or [coach](https://www.notion.so/mokacare/Coach-15c35b2d0a5a4e4382d2aba19faf9b37) other people on the team _e.g: for mentoring: prez tech, book summary_ | Decomposes a technical or business issue into a [solution](https://github.com/moka-care/levels/blob/guidelines.md#probleme-resolution) spanning across multiple Tech PM, Cooldown or Cycle. _e.g: how to implement monitoring_ <hr/> Challenges technical choices, requesting clarification when needed _details: on tech specs, on Pull Request_ | Navigates within at least one other layer than the [codebase](https://github.com/moka-care/levels/blob/guidelines.md#code-vs-stack) (Rails App + MTB): <hr/>   database in-and-out _e.g: index, how to administrate, how to make it efficient_ <hr/>   async processing in-and-out _e.g: jobs, efficient retry, idempotence_ <hr/>   mobile in-and-out _e.g: platform specificity, deployment_ <hr/>   deployment pipelines _e.g: heroku, github actions_ <hr/>   network infrastructure _e.g: dyno, private network_ <hr/>   monitoring and observability _e.g: datadog, apm_ <hr/>   Data software and ETL _e.g: Fivetran_ |  |  | See When writing code |
| D | Team | You actively make the team & app grow with sustainability in mind |  | Presents technical problems with pro's & con's on multiple potential [solutions](https://github.com/moka-care/levels/blob/guidelines.md#probleme-resolution) spanning across multiple aprem / tech cooldown / cycle  <hr/>   Offer solutions to actively reduce complexity. _other level needs to reduce complexicity on written code, this level should do this on existing code_ <hr/>   Identifies large code refacto's to be later decomposed in task or Theme done by them or other team members <hr/>   Anticipates new project, show POCs <hr/>  <hr/> _e.g: should we move away from Redis, merge EmailRule/User_ | Navigates [within many other layers](https://github.com/moka-care/levels/blob/guidelines.md#code-vs-stack) in addition to the App (Rails) / Metabase layer: <hr/>   database in-and-out _e.g: index, how to administrate, how to make it efficient_ <hr/>   async processing in-and-out _e.g: jobs, efficient retry, idempotence_ <hr/>   mobile in-and-out _e.g: platform specificity, deployment_ <hr/>   deployment pipelines _e.g: heroku, github actions_ <hr/>   network infrastructure _e.g: dyno, private network_ <hr/>   monitoring and observability _e.g: datadog, apm_ <hr/>   Data software and ETL _e.g: Fivetran_ |  |  |  |
